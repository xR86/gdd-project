We have made a game prototype for the `Game Design and Development course` at `Faculty of Computer Science Iasi` (FII).

`Page of the course` is available here: [profs.info.uaic.ro/~alaiba/pub/gdd-2017/](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~alaiba/pub/gdd-2017/)

The **phases for developing this project** were as such:
- `game proposal` - week 4 - (design documents and a starter project) - [profs.info.uaic.ro/~alaiba/pub/gdd-2017/Assignment%204.pdf](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~alaiba/pub/gdd-2017/Assignment%204.pdf)
- `game prototype` - week 9 - (updated design documents, game mechanics and basic level design) - [profs.info.uaic.ro/~alaiba/pub/gdd-2017/Week%209.pdf](https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~alaiba/pub/gdd-2017/Week%209.pdf)
- `vertical/horizontal slice` - week 16 - `description found on private fb group for the course`, but the closest group is [GDD IS](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gdd.is/)
- `various game development updates` (almost weekly)
